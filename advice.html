		<h1>How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</h1>
		<p>
			1-Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself.<br>
			2-When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others.<br> This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or <br>.  Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may  <br> be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are <br>in an area where COVID-19 is circulating.
		</p>

		<h1>If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:</h1>
		<p>
			1-If you become ill, even with very mild symptoms you must self-isolate.<br>

			2-Even if you donâ€™t think you have been exposed to COVID-19 but develop symptoms,<br> then self-isolate and monitor yourself.<br>

			3-You are more likely to infect others in the early stages of the disease when you<br> just have mild symptoms, therefore early self-isolation is very important.<br>

			4-If you do not have symptoms, but have been exposed to an infected person,<br> self-quarantine for 14 days.
		</p>
